# Job Suggesting Script

Job searching is a full-time task. You must go through multiple job boards, read numerous job descriptions, check if your experience can be a match, and then apply. In my opinion, it is also a highly manual task. Why can’t we have our computer scan job boards and suggest the jobs we should look at? As part of this article, I build a customizable python script that would scrape the job aggregator website RemoteOK and return jobs I would be interested in. Without further ado, let’s start scripting!
